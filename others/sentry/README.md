Sentry
======

We use the frankly fantastic [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to help us maintain our
services.

This directory contains a version of the Sentry glyph that we've modified to fit in
better with Discord's branding. The Sentry glyph belongs entirely to Sentry, and they
are not associated with us in any way.

Sentry's branding page may be found [here](https://sentry.io/branding/).
